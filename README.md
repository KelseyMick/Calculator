<h1>A simple calculator app made using Python</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
This is a simple calculator app made using Python with the intention of expanding my skills. Throughout my time building the program, I have learned a great deal about how to create a GUI using the Python package Tkinter.

<h2>Features</h2>
This app utilizes the Python package Tkinter in order to build the GUI for the calculator. Tkinter also helped in order to create the funtions for the buttons as well.
The calculator is able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers that the user inputs. The program can also calculate using decimal points. There is also a button that will clear the current output. 
In addition, the app also has an 'undo' button which undos the last input from the user. This is useful if you accidentally click the wrong number.
Finally, the program is able to change the first number to a negative or a position number using the button labelled as '-/+'.

<h2>Installion</h2>
In order to install and run this program, all you need is for Python to be installed. The program will be able to run perfectly afterwards.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The key takeaway from this project was that I got to learn a great deal about building a GUI. 
I feel as though building this calculator program taught me a lot about Tkinter and how it can implemented to help with the different functions of the program.
